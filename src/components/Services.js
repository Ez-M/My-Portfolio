          As a life long student, I know that the best way to learn is through real world experience. 
          I'm always looking to hone my skills and pick up new ones, and the best way to help me in my journey is to let me help you.
          If you have a website or an app that you think I can help make a realtiy, or even just a touchup job to an existing project,
          I'm more than happy to hear about it.
